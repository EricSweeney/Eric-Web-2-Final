            <h2>BIRTHDAY PARTIES</h2>
            <h2>LARGE GROUPS</h2>
            <p>If you are looking for a new and exciting way to celebrate a birthday, then the Downingtown Rock Gym has just the thing. Indoor rock climbing has quickly become a popular recreational activity for all ages and ability levels.</p>
            <p>This birthday party is all rock climbing.  Climbers will start with bouldering (low climbing) and progress to roped climbing.  Climbing walls provide varying degrees of height and difficulty so there is plenty for all ability levels.</p>
            <p>Included is a 2 hour party, harness rentals, unlimited bouldering (low climbing), unlimited roped climbing, private party room, and all paper products. We do the set-up and clean-up. You just handle the food! Downloadable invitations or E-vite.</p>
