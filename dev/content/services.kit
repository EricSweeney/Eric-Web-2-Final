                <div>
                    <h4>$12.00</h4>
                    <p>Bouldering is a form of free climbing performed on shorter walls without the requirements of ropes or a harness. Our Boulder Pass grants two hours of endless climbing on our boulder walls up to a height of 12 feet within our gym. Rental harness or shoes are not required.</p>
